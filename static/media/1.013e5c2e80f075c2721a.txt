Lately I've been baking lots of baguettes. My first few attempts were pretty lackluster - the crust was completely white and it looked like someone bleached it. It still tasted good though! Just missing the visual component.

I watched some youtube videos of baguette making and one of the tricks is that you gotten use a pan filled with water in the baking process. This pan goes on the lower rack of the oven and the moisture created from the steam sticks to the bread crust, allowing it to develop a crispy and brown crust.
